## Description

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

$$0.123456789101112131415161718192021...$$

It can be seen that the $12$th digit of the fractional part is $1$.

If $d_n$ represents the $n$th digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.

## Task

$$d_1 \times d_{10} \times d_{100} \times d_{1000} \times d_{10000} \times d_{100000} \times d_{1000000}$$
