[**Integer Right Triangles**](https://projecteuler.net/problem=39)

## Description

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides $\{a,b,c\}$, there are exactly three solutions for $ p = 120 $.

$ \{20,48,52\}, \{24,45,51\}, \{30,40,50\} $

## Task

For which value of $ p \leq 1000$, is the number of solutions maximised?
