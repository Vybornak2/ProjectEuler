# Problem 17

[**Number Letter Counts**](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17)

## Description:
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are $ 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 $ letters used in total.

## Task:
If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

### NOTE:
Do not count spaces or hyphens.

Example:  
- 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters 
- 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters.

The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
